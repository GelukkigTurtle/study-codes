/*
 * Given an undirected graph with n nodes labeled 1..n. Some of the nodes are already connected.
 *  The i-th edge connects nodes edges[i][0] and edges[i][1] together. 
 *  Your task is to augment this set of edges with additional edges to connect all the nodes. 
 *  Find the minimum cost to add new edges between the nodes such that all the nodes are accessible from each other.

	Input:
	n, an int representing the total number of nodes.
	edges, a list of integer pair representing the nodes already connected by an edge.
	newEdges, a list where each element is a triplet representing the pair of nodes between which an edge can be added and the cost of addition,
	 respectively (e.g. [1, 2, 5] means to add an edge between node 1 and 2, the cost would be 5).
	
	Example:
	Input:
	n = 6, edges = [[1, 4], [4, 5], [2, 3]], newEdges = [[1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 10], [1, 6, 2], [5, 6, 5]]
	Output: 7
	Explanation:
	There are 3 connected components [1, 4, 5], [2, 3] and [6].
	We can connect these components into a single component by connecting node 1 to node 2 and node 1 to node 6 at a minimum cost of 5 + 2 = 7.
	
	hint: whatâ€™s the time complexity of your algorithm? Can you make the running time O(E * log(E)) by using Union Find?
